# Operation-theatre-light

This is a prototype of a 8051 based system that controls the light of 2 LEDs by sensing any obstacles that may cause a shadow during an operation. Please Note: This code cannot be made for production* but only for reference and motivation. Constant intensity of light is required during an operation and a system that automatically controls the shadow was the ambition of the project.
